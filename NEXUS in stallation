How to setup SonaType Nexus3 on Ubuntu:

Java 8 installation
sudo apt update && sudo apt install openjdk-8-jre-headless -y

Note: Nexus is not compatible with Java 11 in Ubuntu 18.0.4. So we need to install Java 8.
java -version


Execute the below commands -  navigate to /opt directory by changing directory:
cd /opt

Download Nexus
sudo wget https://download.sonatype.com/nexus/3/nexus-3.22.0-02-unix.tar.gz

Extract Nexus files

sudo tar -xvf nexus-3.22.0-02-unix.tar.gz
sudo mv nexus-3.22.0-02 nexus

Create a user called Nexus
sudo adduser nexus

give some password may be as admin, but do remember.
Keep entering enter for all other values and press y to confirm the entries.

Give permission to Nexus user

sudo chown -R nexus:nexus /opt/nexus
sudo chown -R nexus:nexus /opt/sonatype-work

sudo vi /opt/nexus/bin/nexus.rc
change run_as_user="nexus"
 



Modify memory settings
sudo vi /opt/nexus/bin/nexus.vmoptions


Add all the below changes the file with below yellow highlighted entry:
-Xms512M
-Xmx512M
-XX:MaxDirectMemorySize=512m

Configure Nexus to run as a service
sudo vi /etc/systemd/system/nexus.service
Copy the below content highlighted in green color.

[Unit]
Description=nexus service
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=forking
LimitNOFILE=65536
User=nexus
Group=nexus
ExecStart=/opt/nexus/bin/nexus start
ExecStop=/opt/nexus/bin/nexus stop
User=nexus
Restart=on-abort 
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

Now Start Nexus
sudo systemctl enable nexus
sudo systemctl start nexus 
sudo systemctl status nexus


if it says stopped, review the steps above and you can troubleshoot by looking into Nexus logs by executing below command:
tail -f /opt/sonatype-work/nexus3/log/nexus.log


Press control C to come out of the above window.
It should say Started Sonatype Nexus OSS 3.22.0-02.  If you Nexus stopped, review the steps above.

Once Nexus is successfully installed, you can access it in the browser by 
URL - http://public_dns_name:8081



Now click on Sign in, enter admin as user name and password by executing below cat command.



cat /opt/sonatype-work/nexus3/admin.password
Now change admin password as admin123




enable anonymous access


Click Finish.
Sign in with user name/password is admin/admin123
you should see the home page of Nexus.

Coach, the Nexus stops because Nexus was not configured to run as a service. Should include:
Configure Nexus to run as a service

sudo vi /etc/systemd/system/nexus.service
Copy the below content highlighted in green color.

[Unit]
Description=nexus service
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=forking
LimitNOFILE=65536
User=nexus
Group=nexus
ExecStart=/opt/nexus/bin/nexus start
ExecStop=/opt/nexus/bin/nexus stop
User=nexus
Restart=on-abort
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
